\begin{quote}
    A mining company produces lignite and anthracite. By the moment, it is able to sell all the coal produced, being the profit per ton of lignite and anthracite 4 and 3 monetary units, respectively. Processing each ton of lignite requires 3 hours of coal cutting machine and another 4 hours for washing. Also, the processing of one ton of anthracite required for same tasks 4 and 2 hours, respectively. The time available daily to each of these activities (cutting and washing) is 12 and 8 hours respectively. Furthermore, it is desired to produce daily 3 tons of coal.
